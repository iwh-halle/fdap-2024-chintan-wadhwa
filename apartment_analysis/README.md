# Literature Review: Determinants of Real Estate Prices in Urban Areas

## Introduction
Understanding the determinants of real estate prices in urban areas is crucial for policymakers, investors, and residents. Real estate prices are influenced by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, demographic trends, and specific characteristics of the properties and neighborhoods. This review synthesizes findings from several academic studies to identify key determinants of real estate prices, focusing on both the supply and demand sides of the market.

## Demand-Side Determinants
*Income and Employment*
Disposable income and employment rates are fundamental demand-side determinants of real estate prices. Higher disposable income increases the purchasing power of individuals, leading to higher demand for housing and consequently higher real estate prices​​. Employment rates similarly impact housing demand; regions with higher employment levels typically experience greater housing demand and higher prices​​.

*Demographic Factors*
Population growth, age structure, and household formation are significant demographic factors affecting housing demand. Rapid population growth increases the demand for housing, driving up prices​​​​. The age distribution of the population also plays a role; areas with a higher proportion of young adults tend to have higher demand for rental properties and starter homes, while areas with older populations may see higher demand for different types of housing​​​​.

*Urbanization and Infrastructure*
Urbanization and the availability of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and transportation networks significantly influence real estate prices. Well-developed infrastructure enhances the desirability of a location, increasing demand and prices​​.

## Supply-Side Determinants
*Housing Stock and Construction Activity*
The availability of housing stock and the level of construction activity are primary supply-side determinants. An increase in housing stock relative to demand can lead to lower prices, while high levels of construction activity typically signal a response to increased demand, which can stabilize or reduce price increases​​. However, new construction in high-demand areas can also drive prices up if the new supply does not keep pace with demand​​.

*Land Availability and Regulations*
The availability of land for new development and regulatory factors such as zoning laws and building codes significantly impact the supply side of the housing market. Limited land availability in urban areas can constrain new construction, leading to higher prices​​. Regulatory environments that are conducive to development can help moderate price increases by facilitating new housing supply​​.

## Macroeconomic Factors
*Interest Rates and Inflation*
Interest rates and inflation are critical macroeconomic factors influencing real estate prices. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, making it easier for individuals to purchase homes, thereby increasing demand and prices​​. Conversely, high inflation can erode purchasing power but can also lead to higher real estate prices as properties are often viewed as a hedge against inflation​​.

*Economic Growth*
Economic growth, as measured by GDP growth, generally leads to increased demand for housing as it typically results in higher income levels and employment rates. Regions experiencing strong economic growth tend to see higher real estate prices​​​​.

## WG Listings Success Factors
*Rental Prices and Market Activity*
Rental prices and the level of market activity are significant factors influencing the success of WG (Wohngemeinschaft) listings. Higher rental prices can indicate a high demand for rental properties, which can reduce the duration a WG listing stays online​​​​. Active markets with frequent transactions also tend to have shorter listing durations as the higher demand facilitates quicker rentals​​​​.

*Property Features and Location*
The specific features of the property, such as size, number of rooms, and amenities, along with its location, play crucial roles in determining the success of WG listings. Listings in desirable locations with good access to public transportation and amenities tend to attract tenants more quickly​​.

## Conclusion
The determinants of real estate prices in urban areas are multifaceted, involving a complex interplay of economic, demographic, and specific property factors. Understanding these determinants can help stakeholders make informed decisions and anticipate market trends. Future research should continue to explore these relationships, particularly in the context of changing economic conditions and urban development patterns.
